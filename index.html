  <h1>Reach For The Floor</h1>
  <p>When I started my fitness journey, one of the first problems I ran into was</p>
  <p>the fact that I could not assume the proper form in many of the exercises</p>
  <p>I wanted to try simply because of my lack of flexibility. Heck, I couldn't even</p>
  <p>touch my toes! My gym friends have been so supportive in helping me grow, but I</p>
  <p>wanted to take a more deliberate effort in learning how to help and grow myself</p>
  <p>which is why I made this website. I want to document and share all the new things that I</p>
  <p>am learning. So welcome to my journey!</p>
